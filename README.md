# hsisomap

> An **NAENH-ISOMAP** (*Noise-Aware ENHanced Isometric-Mapping*, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction (manifold learning) algorithm for *highly-noisy, large-scale, high-dimensional* data) implementation for hyperspectral imagery, and general-purpose dimensionality reduction library. 

> hsisomap is now pre-released. 

## Introduction

The initial goal of the project is to demonstrate a novel noise-aware ISOMAP algorithm and workflow for hyperspectral imagery (See references). The core algorithms consisting the workflow have been implemented as a C++ library, and the workflow has been implemented in a commandline tool, as well as a GUI tool to facilitate the use of the workflow in real-world hyperspectral imagery analysis. 

At the same time, the project can be used as a general-purpose dimensionality reduction library, as many of the consisting components include commonly used functionality in image analysis and machine learning, such as MNF (Minimum Noise Fraction), PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Landmark ISOMAP, and modules that can be useful such as kNN graph generation, OpenCL based Dijkstra algorithm etc. 

These general-purpose modules can be called as static library or used as source code. The commandline and GUI tool can also be used for general-purpose dimensionality reduction for data not limiting to hyperspectral imagery. The commandline tool implements a JSON based human-readable configuration. The GUI tool can be used to facilitate the configuration file generation and task execution. 

## Architecture

### Components

The project consists the following build targets: 

- `libhsisomap`: static library of hsisomap. 
- `hsisomap_cli`: commandline tool to execute NAENH-ISOMAP and other tasks with configuration files. Dependent on `libhsisomap`.
- `demo`: code containing examples to use `libhsisomap` directly. Dependent on `libhsisomap`.
- `hsisomap_gui`: GUI tool to facilitate the use of `hsisomap_cli` and creating / editing configuration files. Requires `hsisomap_cli`.
- `gtest`: unit-tests for `libhsisomap` (dependent).


### Modules

See Documentation. 

## Installation

hsisomap does not provide pre-compiled releases at this stage. The library and tools should be compiled from source repository. 

hsisomap is cross-platformed. It is being tested under macOS and Linux. It should also work under Windows with proper configuration but it has not been tested. 

### Compiler and Dependencies

The dependencies to compile `libhsisomap`, `hsisomap_cli` and `demo` includes (the version number followed is the developing / testing environment; early versions may work but not tested): 

- GNU Scientific Library (GSL) `2.2.1`
- Boost `1.57.0`
- OpenCL `2.0`

The dependency to compile `hsisomap_cli` is:

- Qt 5 `5.7.1`

The compilers tested are:

- Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)
- G++ (TBD)

To compile the project automatically, CMake is also required. 

- CMake `3.6.2`

Optionally, the documentation can be generated by Doxygen:

- Doxygen `1.8.13`

Below are platform-specific instructions to compile the project. 

#### macOS

The compiler and `OpenCL.framework` are automatically installed by Xcode, which can be obtained from Mac App Store. 

The easiest way to install dependencies on macOS is [homebrew](http://brew.sh). The link contains the instruction to install homebrew. After install homebrew, type the following commands in Terminal: 

```bash
brew install gsl boost cmake qt5 doxygen
```

`qt5` or `doxygen` parameter can be removed from the command if you do not need to compile GUI tool or generate HTML documentation locally. 

#### Linux

TBD

#### Windows

TBD

### Build

#### Build All Targets 

After all dependencies are installed, download and build the project as follows: 

1. Download the source code repository by `git clone` or downloading and extracting the  `.zip` archive. 
2. In Terminal, navigate to the source code root path, the top folder containing `README.md`. 
3. Execute the following commands to build all targets (excluding unit tests for Release build type) in `build` subfolder:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

​	Replace `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to build with debug configuration. Note that debug configuration will have significant performance impact on certain steps of the workflow and should only be used in development. If the build type is not specified, the behavior is undefined. 

​	CMake will automatically configure and compile the project, and the outcome is in `build/` folder, either in `Release/` or `Debug/` subfolder depending on the build type. The executives (`hsisomap_cli`, `demo`, GUI tool (TBD)) and example files are in `bin/` subfolder, and the static library `libhsisomap.a` is in `lib` subfolder. 

There is currently no installation configuration. You will need to manually copy these outcomes (and header files from `include/` folder of the source repository if you need to use the library in your code) into the path you want. 

#### Generate Documentation (Optional) 

The official website contains full documentation of the source code. If you need a local copy, please use Doxygen to generate them locally. 

1. In Terminal, navigate to the root path of the project.
2. Execute the following commands:

```bash
cd doc
doxygen
```

The generated HTML and LaTeX documentation are in `doc/html` and `doc/latex` respectively. For HTML documentation, locate `index.html` for the home page. 

#### Build Using IDE

The easiest way to build / debug / develop using the project is to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The recommended IDE is [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/). It can open the project directly and compile without configuration. Just open the project by importing the project root folder. 

The only caveat is that you will need to manually create the scheme to build the targets in `Release` mode, otherwise the performance might be impacted for certain steps of the workflow. For CLion, click on the target dropdown menu on the top-right of the window, select "Edit Configurations". Then select one target, and click "Copy Configuration" button on the top toolbar. Select the new target, and change the "Configuration" dropdown menu to "Release". Also change the name to be like this. Perform this action for each build target (excluding unit tests). Use "Release" configuration for production, and "Debug" for development. 

In some versions of CLion, "Release" mode may not be presented in the dialog. This means you need to manually specify that you need this mode before editing the configuration. Go to "Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> CMake", click the "+" button below the "Generation" listbox. Then the "Release" item should be automatically added into the listbox. 

## Usage

This section specifies the usage of the commandline tool. For GUI tool, navigate to the GUI tool README. This is for people who want to use the program as a tool in their high-dimensional data analysis workflow. 

TBD

## Examples

This section explains some of the examples in `demo` program. This is for people who want to use the library or code in their projects.

The full documentation of the project is generated by Doxygen. Click here to view the documentation (TBD).  If you want to generate documentation locally, refer to "Build" section.
